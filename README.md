formal-weyl
===========
The algebra for formal power series in elements of the Weyl algebra
In particular it allows Taylor expansions of expressions like exp(z*(a^2-a'^2)/2) (which occur in the the theory of squeezed light) where a and a' don't commute and [a,a']=1.

This is a completed project. The code isn't perfect but it allowed me to perform certain computations I wanted to experiment with.
